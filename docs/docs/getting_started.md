## step1. clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ianre657/plus.git
```

## step2. Install dependencies

Follow [Install Dependecies](./install_deps)

## step3. Setup configuration files

### `.env` file

We use a `.env` file to store global variables for all of our dockerfiles.

Use `./onboarding.sh` to propagate those files.


## step4. Start Developing

Use `docker compose up` to start the project.

Open your browser with `localhost:8888` to see the result.

See `Development Flow`(wip), `Code of Conducts`(wip) for more information.
