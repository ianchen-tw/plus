## Description

`plus` is an API server for students to build a better college course experience.

It is intend to be minimal and well-documented.

This project borrow lots of ideas from [full-stack-fastapi-postgresql](https://github.com/tiangolo/full-stack-fastapi-postgresql), take a look at [fastapi](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) to gain more knowledge on the structure of this project and the intrinsic to building servers.

Happy coding!
